# here i want to introduce a very usual senario or you could call it error：
# when u want to create a index when you first logging into kibana web, you should create an index pattern, and you may
# get info like in you website or log:
"""
Warning No default index pattern. You must select or create one to continue.
...
Unable to fetch mapping. Do you have indices matching the pattern?
"""
# this is because you do not have any data in your logstash storiage, you could initial data with your own source or
# just go through "get_start_1" tutorial.
# When you define an index pattern, indices that match that pattern must exist in Elasticsearch.
# Those indices must contain data.

Let's create our index parttern:
Shakespeare data set has an index named shakespeare, and the accounts data set has an index named bank
>>
health status index               pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   shakespeare           1   0     111396            0     16.2mb         16.2mb
green  open   logstash-2015.05.20   1   0       4750            0     20.9mb         20.9mb
green  open   bank                  1   0       1000            0    374.1kb        374.1kb

An index pattern is a string with optional wildcards that can match multiple indices. For example, in the common logging
use case, a typical index name contains the date in YYYY.MM.DD format, and an index pattern for May would look something
like logstash-2015.05*.

tips: we could see that above log have index of "shakespeare, logstash-2015.05.20, bank", which you may find in
get_start_1 file, c? that is the index.

Click the Settings tab, then the Indices tab.
Click Add New to define a new index pattern:
1. Two of the sample data sets, the Shakespeare plays and the financial accounts, don’t contain time-series data. Make
sure the Index contains time-based events box is >>>unchecked<<< when you create index patterns for these data sets.
2. Specify shakes* as the index pattern for the Shakespeare data set and click Create to define the index pattern, then
define a second index pattern named ba*.
3. The Logstash data set does contain time-series data, so after clicking Add New to define the index for this data set,
make sure the Index contains time-based events box is checked and select the @timestamp field from the Time-field name
drop-down.
