# discover the data
You can construct searches by using the field names and the values youâ€™re interested in. With numeric fields you can use
comparison operators such as greater than (>), less than (<), or equals (=). You can link elements with the logical
operators AND, OR, and NOT, all in uppercase.
To try it out, select the ba* index pattern and enter the following query string in the query bar:
>>> account_number:<100 AND balance:>47500 <<<
This query returns all account numbers between zero and 99 with balances in excess of 47,500. When searching the sample
bank data, it returns 5 results: Account numbers 8, 32, 78, 85, and 97.

# further more, you could decide which fileds or items display
